Rules for Defining Identifiers:
There are certain valid rules for defining a valid Go identifier. 
These rules should be followed, otherwise, we will get a compile-time error.

The name of the identifier must begin with a letter or an underscore(_). 
the names may contain the letters ‘a-z’ or ’A-Z’ or digits 0-9 as well as the character ‘_’.
The name of the identifier should not start with a digit.
The name of the identifier is case sensitive.
Keywords is not allowed to use as an identifier name.
There is no limit on the length of the name of the identifier, but it is advisable to use an optimum length of 4 – 15 letters only.
