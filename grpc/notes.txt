============ Ubuntu (Linux) ============

Find the correct protocol buffers version based on your Linux Distro: https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases

Example with x64:

# Make sure you grab the latest version
curl -OL https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/download/v3.5.1/protoc-3.5.1-linux-x86_64.zip
# Unzip
unzip protoc-3.5.1-linux-x86_64.zip -d protoc3
# Move protoc to /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv protoc3/bin/* /usr/local/bin/
# Move protoc3/include to /usr/local/include/
sudo mv protoc3/include/* /usr/local/include/
# Optional: change owner
sudo chown [user] /usr/local/bin/protoc
sudo chown -R [user] /usr/local/include/google


 You should properly define your GO_PATH - where your go packages live. In other words, GO_PATH is your go workspace. The GO_PATH should be ~/go.

protoc-gen-go should be in your PATH. While protoc-gen-go lives in $GO_PATH/bin after you installed it.

Add these 2 important lines to your ~/.bash_profile:

export GO_PATH=~/go
export PATH=$PATH:/$GO_PATH/bin
Then you need to start a new shell session or just type in this line:

$ source ~/.bash_profile
